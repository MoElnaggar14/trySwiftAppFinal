# trySwiftApp
try! Swift Conference App

## TODO
- [x] Create `data.json` template
- [x] Decode models from JSON
- [x] Get (Q&A) session for a specific day
- [x] Add UIImage assets
- [x] Add fallback with imageURL
- [x] Cleanup imageURL fallbacks
- [ ] Add API / JSON to website
- [ ] Periodically (or just every startup?) check if the json file's version is still up-to-date
- [x] If there is a new version of the JSON, download it and persist it; use that until it becomes outdated again
- [ ] Add Code of conduct to API and display it *nicely* in the app
- [ ] Generate acknowledgements to include new libraries (how can I do this?)
- [ ] Make speaker images in Q&A tappable without 3D Touch (or was this intentional in any way?!)
- [ ] Show speaker images in Q&A flexible; they should show as many speaker images as there are speakers (instead of a fixed 3). Now, tapping on an "empty" speaker image crashes the app
- [ ] Add a fallback to the "hardcoded" JSON if neccesary.
- [ ] ??
